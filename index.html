<p>Over the last decade India witnessed immense influence of esports on the youth to say the least. In India, 19% of the population spends between 1-7 hours playing mobile games in a week and 11% between 7-14 hours. India has become the largest mobile gaming market in terms of app downloads.

    What started with competitive gaming restricted only to be practised in fests, competitions, local events and tournaments in the late 2000s is now a Rs 250-crore industry with more than 600,000 players and 100,000 teams. Indiaâ€™s participation in various esports events at Commonwealth Esports Championships and the Asian Games 2022 wasnâ€™t the first time India participated in such esports at the Asian Games.
    
    Earlier in 2018 India participated in the tournament that was held in Jakarta. India was among the 18 participants of the inaugural Esports demonstration event and had managed to secure bronze in Hearthstone, credit to Mr. Tirth Mehta.
    
    However, it will now be crucial, for esports will be held as an officially recognised medal sport this time. India will participate at the continental tournament in five different games â€” FIFA 22, Street Fighter V, Hearthstone, League of Legends, and DOTA 2. French President Emmanuel Macron publicly stated that he wants esports to be included in the 2024 Paris Olympics, it is about time that competitive gaming gets featured in the Olympics and the upcoming Commonwealth Games as well.
    
    Around 46 countries have recognised esports as a regular sport like Korea, Thailand, Italy, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc.
    
    With more than 500 million esports fans in 152 countries the global viewership of esports has steeply raised in the past few years. Acc. to the latest data from YouGov Global Profiles, one in four global consumers (25%) spends at least 7 hours of their week playing video games on their smart phones. YouTube, Facebook Gaming, Loco, and Rooter are best for video game streaming show in India.
    
    Streamers have been able to monetise their content and earn a great deal. Moreover, the rise of esports in India will broaden employment opportunities that include esports advertising, marketing, coaching, content creators, esports journalists, game designers, etc. Streaming is a great business option. There is a great potential of revenue growth as well. The Indian esports industry also experienced many Indian multiplex like INOX Leisure and PVR bringing the action of esports to their cinemas. Other sources of income generation are where celebrities like rappers, sportsmen, actors, and other famous individuals leverage esports as a way to increase their engagement with the audience and increasing their earnings.
    
    Example: Tiger Shroff is a brand ambassador for Esports Premier League, cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal signed up with Rooter as a content creator,etc.
